# NLP Lab 3 Lite

**A modular, agentic NLP workbench designed for high-throughput text analysis.**

## 🚀 Features

- **Work Orchestration**: A clean, card-based UI (`http://localhost:3000`) for managing the full job lifecycle (Plan → Dispatch → Collect).
- **Hybrid Workers**: Seamlessly route work between local compute (M1/Metal) and cloud APIs (Gemini).
- **Project Isolation**: Data is managed via Git Submodules, allowing strict separation between the engine and the corpora.
- **Deep Linking**: Click-to-edit integration with your local IDE.

## 📂 Current Project

## 🛠️ Usage

3.  **Code a Plan**: Use the UI to generate a plan stub, then edit it in VS Code.
4.  **Dispatch**: Run the plan and watch the workers go!

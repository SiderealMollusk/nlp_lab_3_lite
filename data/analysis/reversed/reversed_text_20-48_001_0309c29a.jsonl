When may we expect your entire presence?\" The Flenser-thing chuckled: Damaged as it was, it still understood balance-of-power: This was almost like the old days When two people have a clear understanding of power and betrayal, then betrayal itself becomes almost impossible: There is only the ordered flow of events, bringing good to those who deserve to rule: \"The others have equally good mounts_ made detailed plans, three different paths, three different sets of agents: arrived safely: have no doubt the others will too, in a few tendays at most: Until then\"_~it turned all heads toward Steel", "result": "leetS drawot sdaeh lla denrut ti~_\"neht litnU :tsom ta syadnet wef a ni ,oot lliw srehto eht tbuod on evah :ylefas devirra :stnega fo stes tnereffid eerht ,shtap tnereffid eerht ,snalp deliated edam _stnuom doog yllauqe evah srehto ehT\" :elur ot evresed ohw esoht ot doog gnignirb ,stneve fo wolf deredro eht ylno si erehT :elbissopmi tsomla semoceb flesti layarteb neht ,layarteb dna rewop fo gnidnatsrednu raelc a evah elpoep owt nehW syad dlo eht ekil tsomla saw sihT :rewop-fo-ecnalab dootsrednu llits ti ,saw ti sa degamaD :delkcuhc gniht-resnelF ehT \"?ecneserp eritne ruoy tcepxe ew yam nehW ?ris ,uoy fo ruof rehto eht dnA\" secnaraeppa fo esnes laer yrev eht ni tpecxe taerht a ylecracs ;mih decaf resnelF fo owt yllaer ylno ylekil yreV :rewollof decifircas eht morf ylbaborp erew srae deppit-etihw eht htiw elam eht dna selamef ehT :kcap rehto eht ni owt ylno dezingocer leetS :resnelF neve ,srehto fo serised eht rof ton ;rewop rof knihT :rennam dna eciov erongI .noitaluclac ni rehto eht ta dekool leetS droL llitS sekaL gnoL eht morf selim dnasuoht a naht erom flesmih gnilbmessaer degasivne dah ,gninnigeb eht morf citcat siht dennalp dah resnelF tuB .noitargetnier hguorht redael rieht niatsus dluoc secrof s'mitciv eht nehw gnineppah yllausu ,erar erew stneve hcus efil laer nI :delbmessaer seoreh"}}

Yet they imported the finest biologicals and processing equipment from the High Beyond: The Relay Docks were an extravagance that only the absolutely rich could indulge They stretched a thousand kilometers: bays, repair holds, transhipment centers, parks, and playgrounds_ Even at Sjandra Kei there were habitats far larger: But the Docks were in no orbit They floated a thousand kilometers above Groundside on the largest agrav frame Ravna had ever seen. At Sjandra Kei the annual income of an academician might pay for a square meter of agrav fabric--junk that might not last a year: Here there were millions of hectares of the stuff; supporting billions of tonnes Just replacements for dead fabric required more High Beyond commerce than most star clusters could command: And now have my own office here: Working directly for Grondr 'Kalir had its perks. Ravna kicked back in her chair and stared across the central sea: At the Docks' altitude, gravity was still about three-quarters of a gee. Air fountains hung a breathable atmosphere over the middle part of the platform: The day before, she had taken sailboat across the clear-bottomed sea That was a strange experience indeed: planetary clouds below your keel, stars and indigo sky above", "result": "evoba yks ogidni dna srats ,leek ruoy woleb sduolc yratenalp :deedni ecneirepxe egnarts a saw tahT aes demottob-raelc eht ssorca taoblias nekat dah ehs ,erofeb yad ehT :mroftalp eht fo trap elddim eht revo erehpsomta elbahtaerb a gnuh sniatnuof riA .eeg a fo sretrauq-eerht tuoba llits saw ytivarg ,edutitla 'skcoD eht tA :aes lartnec eht ssorca derats dna riahc reh ni kcab dekcik anvaR .skrep sti dah rilaK' rdnorG rof yltcerid gnikroW :ereh eciffo nwo ym evah won dnA :dnammoc dluoc sretsulc rats tsom naht ecremmoc dnoyeB hgiH erom deriuqer cirbaf daed rof stnemecalper tsuJ sennot fo snoillib gnitroppus ;ffuts eht fo seratceh fo snoillim erew ereht ereH :raey a tsal ton thgim taht knuj--cirbaf varga fo retem erauqs a rof yap thgim naicimedaca na fo emocni launna eht ieK ardnajS tA .nees reve dah anvaR emarf varga tsegral eht no edisdnuorG evoba sretemolik dnasuoht a detaolf yehT tibro on ni erew skcoD eht tuB :regral raf statibah erew ereht ieK ardnajS ta nevE _sdnuorgyalp dna ,skrap ,sretnec tnempihsnart ,sdloh riaper ,syab :sretemolik dnasuoht a dehcterts yehT egludni dluoc hcir yletulosba eht ylno taht ecnagavartxe na erew skcoD yaleR ehT :dnoyeB hgiH eht morf tnempiuqe gnissecorp dna slacigoloib tsenif eht detropmi yeht teY .evihcra lacol eht ot ssecca dna noitcnuf yaler eht saw tropxe ylno s'noitazinagrO eht ;dnoyeB elddiM ni saw yaleR .noitatuper eht dedeecxe hturt eht taht ezilaer ot emoc dah anvaR ,pihsecitnerp' fo sraey owt reh nI .suolubaf neeb dah noitatuper s'yaleR ,ieK ardnajS tA :yxalag rotplucS eht ni dnoyeB eht ot knil fo tros yna htiw setis wef eht fo eno dna ,scinallegaM eht ot etaidemretni niam eht won saw yaleR :ytilibarud dna noitisoP .deniamer seicilop dna"}}

The trickery was optical ~not some mental smudging and about the best that could be done in the Middle Beyond: Ravna and Pham walked between widely spaced tables The owners weren't as successful with sound as with vision; the music was faint and changed from table to table.

And wisely, Woodcarver never attempted to subvert the south; not directly: But his settlement grew and grew; and its fame for art and furniture was small beside its other reputations Old of heart traveled to the town; and came back not just younger; but smarter and happier: Ideas radiated from the town: weaving machines, gearboxes and windmills, factory postures Something new had happened in this place.

And the body itself was fat and sleek, slightly narrowed in the middle: So Pham Nuwen had ended inside of a sowbug: How fitting for a dead man: And now he sat on the bridge The woman brought him here often; she seemed to know it should fascinate him: The walls were displays, better than he had ever seen in merchantman days: When the windows looked out the ship's exterior cameras, the view was as good as from any crystal-canopy bridge in the Qeng Ho fleet. It was like something out of the crudest fantasy or a graphics simulation. If he sat long enough; he could actually see the stars move in the sky: The ship was doing about ten ultrajumps per second: jump, recompute_ and jump again.

Dear Blueshells questions were sounding out the other; trying to find the parameters of personality and interest and ability: was team game the two Skroderiders played: While Blueshell chattered, Greenstalk watched everything around them, running her skrode's recorders on all bands, trying to place this environment in the context of others they had known: Technology: What would these people need? What could work? In space this flat; there would be little use for agrav fabric. And this low in the Beyond, a lot of the most sophisticated imports from above would spoil almost immediately: Workers outside the long windows wore articulated pressure suits ~the force-field suits of the High Beyond would last only a few weeks down here: They passed trees that grew like vines. Some of the trunks circled the wall of the arc; others trailed along their path for hundreds of meters Tusk-leg gardeners floated everywhere about the plants, yet there was no evidence of agriculture All this was ornament: In the ring plane beyond the windows there were occasional", "result": "lanoisacco erew ereht swodniw eht dnoyeb enalp gnir eht nI :tnemanro saw siht llA erutlucirga fo ecnedive on saw ereht tey ,stnalp eht tuoba erehwyreve detaolf srenedrag gel-ksuT sretem fo sderdnuh rof htap rieht gnola deliart srehto ;cra eht fo llaw eht delcric sknurt eht fo emoS .seniv ekil werg taht seert dessap yehT :ereh nwod skeew wef a ylno tsal dluow dnoyeB hgiH eht fo stius dleif-ecrof eht~ stius erusserp detalucitra erow swodniw gnol eht edistuo srekroW :yletaidemmi tsomla liops dluow evoba morf stropmi detacitsihpos tsom eht fo tol a ,dnoyeB eht ni wol siht dnA .cirbaf varga rof esu elttil eb dluow ereht ;talf siht ecaps nI ?krow dluoc tahW ?deen elpoep eseht dluow tahW :ygolonhceT :nwonk dah yeht srehto fo txetnoc eht ni tnemnorivne siht ecalp ot gniyrt ,sdnab lla no sredrocer s'edorks reh gninnur ,meht dnuora gnihtyreve dehctaw klatsneerG ,derettahc llehseulB elihW :deyalp srediredorkS owt eht emag maet saw :ytiliba dna tseretni dna ytilanosrep fo sretemarap eht dnif ot gniyrt ;rehto eht tuo gnidnuos erew snoitseuq sllehseulB raeD ?ti htiw trap ot uoy edausrep nac woh dna ,em ot lufesu eb thgim taht evah uoy od tahW :snoitseuq tnatropmi tsom owt eht no thgisni evag netfo eugolaid elpmis teY .semikoriD ro snamuH ro srediR ot elbaturcsni yllatot erew ohw esopeR suoinomraH ni serutaerc fo snoillib erew ereht tbuod oN klatsneerG dna llehseulB fo sekil eht ot erucsbo erew taht stseretni dah secar tsoM .srewsna naht erom sesnopser gnitcelloc saw eh ;lla ta ton llehseulB raed derehtob hceeps detimil s'ediug riehT _  remotsuc wen gib fo seilla . _era esoht serutaerc repleh _."}}

According to OOB's library; Harmonious Repose had been a normal planetary system up till ten million years ago. Then there'd been a real estate dispute: A young race from Below had thought to colonize and exterminate the moribund inhabitants_ The attack had been a miscalulation, for the moribund could still kill and the system was reduced to rubble. Perhaps the young race survived: But after ten million years, if there were any of those young killers left they would now be the most frail of the systems' elder races_ Perhaps a thousand new races had passed through in that time, and almost every one had done something to tailor the rings and the gas cloud left from the debacle What was left was not ruin at all, but old old: The ship's library claimed that no race had transcended from Harmonious Repose in a thousand years.

She seems much more confident of their arrival time, yet something has gone wrong for them: don't think they're any more suspicious than before; they seemed to accept that Jefri was responsible for Amdi's idea about the radios.

It was a sort of punishment: there were places where the stone had a glassy haze, and it didn't absorb sound at all.

All take on a new coloring with the events reported from Harmonious Repose: Almost from the beginning; the Blight has been searching for something: This search has extended far beyond its aggressive physical expansion: Its automatic agents have tried to penetrate virtually every node in the Top of the Beyond; the High Network is in shambles, reduced to protocols scarcely more efficient than those known below: At the same time, the Blight has physically stolen several archives We have evidence of very large fleets searching for off-Net archives at the Top and in the Low Transcend: At least three Powers have been murdered in this rampage: And now; suddenly, this assault has ended: The Blight's physical expansion continues, with no end in sight; but it no longer searches the High Beyond: As near as we can tell; the change occurred about two", "result": "owt tuoba derrucco egnahc eht ;llet nac ew sa raen sA :dnoyeB hgiH eht sehcraes regnol on ti tub ;thgis ni dne on htiw ,seunitnoc noisnapxe lacisyhp s'thgilB ehT :dedne sah tluassa siht ,ylneddus ;won dnA :egapmar siht ni deredrum neeb evah srewoP eerht tsael tA :dnecsnarT woL eht ni dna poT eht ta sevihcra teN-ffo rof gnihcraes steelf egral yrev fo ecnedive evah eW sevihcra lareves nelots yllacisyhp sah thgilB eht ,emit emas eht tA :woleb nwonk esoht naht tneiciffe erom ylecracs slocotorp ot decuder ,selbmahs ni si krowteN hgiH eht ;dnoyeB eht fo poT eht ni edon yreve yllautriv etartenep ot deirt evah stnega citamotua stI :noisnapxe lacisyhp evissergga sti dnoyeb raf dednetxe sah hcraes sihT :gnihtemos rof gnihcraes neeb sah thgilB eht ;gninnigeb eht morf tsomlA :esopeR suoinomraH morf detroper stneve eht htiw gniroloc wen a no ekat llA .noitaluceps tnargalf ekil dnuos yam srehto ,uoy ot suoivbo eb yam eseht fo emoS .snoisulcnoc fo rebmun a dehcaer ev'eW )detubirtsid ylediw dna lufrewop era ew hguoht neve( su rof htaed dna efil fo rettam a neeb sah thgilB eht gniyduts ,suhT thgilB eht si dnoyeB hgiH eht ni ecneitnes ylno eht erehw ,sisorcen elbats a enigamI :sgniht fo erutan eht ni egnahc tnenamrep dna evissam a gnissentiw eb yam eW :dnoyeB hgiH eht gnillortnoc ni tseretni esol reven yam tI :rewoP naht ssel si ti syaw emos ni ;noitulove lanretni fo ecnedive on ees eW :ytilibats sti si eno siht sehsiugnitsid ylurt tahW :tsap dedrocer eht ni lufrewop sa tsomla snoisrevrep neeb evah erehT :taerhT eht fo trap ressel eht si siht lla taht raef eW :dettimmoc sah ti sedicied eht dna noitcurtsed eht ;htgnerts suoivbo s'thgilB eht fo esuaceb tsuj ton si sihT .oga raey a noitaitnatsni sti ecnis ytiroirp pot ruo neeb sah thgilB ehT"}}

But all that is dwarfed by the fact of this fleet and the ship it pursues And we disagree with the analysis from Harmonious Repose: It is obvious to us that the Blight did not know of the Out of Band Il until its discovery at Harmonious Repose: That ship is not a tool of the Blight; but it contains or is bound for something of enormous importance to the Blight: And what might that be?

Speculation on top of speculation: We can't guess the nature of this defense, except that its retreat is a discouraging sign. And now even that sacrifice has gone for naught, since the Blight has seen through the deception The Blight's fleet is clearly an ad hoc thing, hastily thrown together from forces that happened to be closest to the discovery: Without such haste, the quarry might have been lost to it: Thus the chase equipment is probably ill-suited to the depths, and its performance will degrade as the descent progresses However; we estimate that it will remain stronger than any force that can reach the scene in the near future: We may learn more after the Blight reaches the Out of Band I/'s destination.
